/**
 * Control which parts of compilation pipeline are enabled and how compiler should validate their invariants.
 * Phase configuration that does not know anything about actual compiler pipeline upfront.
 *
 * @property verbose specify a set of phases that must print additional information during phase execution.
 * @property toDumpStateBefore specify a set of phases for which the state must be dumped right before phase execution.
 * @property toDumpStateAfter specify a set of phases for which the state must be dumped right after phase execution.
 * @property toValidateStateBefore specify a set of phases for which the compiler must validate state right before phase execution.
 * @property toValidateStateAfter specify a set of phases for which the compiler must validate state right after phase execution.
 * @property dumpToDirectory returns a path to a directory that should store phase dump. `null` if directory is not set.
 * @property dumpOnlyFqName returns a fully-qualified name that should be used to filter phase dump. `null` if dump should not be filtered.
 * @property needProfiling returns true if compiler should measure how long takes each phase.
 * @property checkConditions returns true if compiler should check pre- and post-conditions of compiler phases.
 * @property checkStickyConditions returns true if compiler should check post-conditions that are applicable to subsequent (thus "sticky") phases.
